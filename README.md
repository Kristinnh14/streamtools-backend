# Streamtools - Backend (Express)

Used in production for RLÍS streams (Rocket League Ísland). This is a backend to support the Frontend with Data and logic.

## Description

The backend for the Streamtools - Frontend **LINK TO REPO**. 

This is the most thrown together API you could find. There is a lot of wiggle room for improvements.

 - Data is kept in json files
 - All API calls are in app.js
 - There is no `.env` og `.conf` files with variables. They are hardcoded in.
 - Team logos are kept here on the backend server.
 - No comments for api calls.

It gets the job done though, and with almost no issues. Next.js makes more sens for Streamtools though. And perhaps a better data repository than json files.

## Prerequisites

To run the project you need `Node.js` and `npm`. Here is a link to download Node.js and npm should come with it.

 - https://nodejs.org/en

The version I am using right is `v16.11.1` but I dont think future version should break the project. A future project would be to dockerize this project for full version control, but more on that later.

### Installation & Run

If all the prerequisites are there you must simply run 

```sh
npm install
```

To install all the node modules. Then to run the Streamtools front end just run

```sh
node app.js
```

## Future Improvements

Perhaps use something else than json for storing data. Also use Next.js and streams
